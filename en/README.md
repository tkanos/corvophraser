# Corvophraseur New Generation

Corvophraseur New Generation is a Python script that generates random technobabble phrases, inspired by science fiction. It uses predefined templates and substitutes placeholders with randomly selected verbs, adjectives, and nouns to create unique and entertaining sentences.

## Features

- Generates random sci-fi phrases using a combination of verbs, adjectives, and nouns.
- Includes a variety of templates (gabarits) for diverse sentence structures.
- Supports prefixes to enhance word combinations.

## Example Output

Here are some examples of the phrases generated by the script:

- "If we can amplify the adaptive shield, we could stabilize the nuclear core and override the vortex."
- "Captain, I can't decode the signal because the ballistic field is about to destabilize the quantum flux!"
- "Warning! The magnetic vortex seems to destabilize dangerously! We have to neutralize the adaptive shield urgently!!!"

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/corvophraser.git
   cd corvophraser/en

## How Templates Work

The script uses predefined templates with placeholders that get replaced with random words:

### Placeholder Types
- `[v]` - Verb (e.g., "amplify", "decode", "stabilize")
- `[a]` - Adjective (e.g., "adaptive", "quantum", "nuclear")
- `[n]` - Noun (e.g., "shield", "core", "vortex")
- `[d]` - Verb with "to" prefix (e.g., "to amplify", "to stabilize")
- `[m]` - Masculine noun
- `[f]` - Feminine noun

### Template Examples
1. Basic Pattern:
   ```
   "If we can [v] the [a] [n], we could [v] the [a] [n] and [v] the [n]"
   ↓
   "If we can amplify the adaptive shield, we could stabilize the nuclear core and override the vortex"
   ```

2. Warning Pattern:
   ```
   "Warning! The [a] [n] seems [v] dangerously!"
   ↓
   "Warning! The magnetic vortex seems destabilize dangerously!"
   ```

### Word Enhancement
- Words can be enhanced with prefixes (20% chance):
  ```
  normal: "core" → with prefix: "cyber-core"
  normal: "stabilize" → with prefix: "auto-stabilize"
  ```

- Available prefixes include: aero-, cyber-, meta-, quantum-, etc.

### Sentence Structure
```
[Starting phrase] + [verb phrase] + [object phrase] + [conditional phrase]
     ↓                   ↓              ↓                    ↓
"Captain,"  +     "I can't decode" + "the signal" + "because the ballistic field..."
```

This template system ensures variety while maintaining coherent sci-fi technobabble structure.
